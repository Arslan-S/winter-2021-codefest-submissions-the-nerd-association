# Hunter Codefest 2020-2021
Project Description: The Hunter Nebula

Our project is to create a website for Hunter College students to view statistics of professors and their respective courses based on student evaluations. To do this, we meant to create a user authentication system in where the person must have an Hunter College email and be sent a password to that account to login. However, with the backend being a work in progress, this has not been made just yet. We also planned to create a review section that allowed Hunter Students to review courses and their professors to gauge on selecting certain courses based  on the class performance and teaching styles of the instructor.

# How to run
